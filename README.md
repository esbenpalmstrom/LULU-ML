# bachelorprojekt
Repository containing a pipeline script produced for my bacherlors thesis.
The LULC_notebook_example.ipynb contain an example notebook for the project.
The pipeline4.py contain the script used for running a larger version of the project, and some plotting functions. It is quite messy though so i recommend going trough the notebook.
