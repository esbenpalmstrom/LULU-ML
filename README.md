# Predicting land-use and land-cover using Machine Learning
Repository containing a pipeline script and a notebook.

The notebook example displays a small example of the pipeline used for larger runs.

Some of the code was forked from github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn and modified to work with my data and circumstances. Much of the data had to go through a preparation process using various GIS tools and other software.
